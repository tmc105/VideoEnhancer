# Video Enhancer

Give YouTube, Twitch, and Kick streams a sharper, more vivid look with a single click or fine-tuned controls.

## Key Features

- **Inline overlay button** – hover the primary video to instantly toggle the enhancement preset.
- **Floating control panel** – drag the panel anywhere, switch between a one-click preset and fully custom sliders for sharpen, contrast, saturation, brightness, and gamma.
- **Responsive to SPA navigation** – the overlay follows you across watch pages and live channels without reloads.
- **GPU-friendly sharpening** – blends CSS filters with an SVG-based sharpen pass for crisp playback on modern hardware.

## How It Works

1. Pin the extension and click the toolbar icon whenever you want to open or hide the control panel.
2. Start with the preset toggle for an instant boost, or move to the Settings tab to dial in each filter individually.
3. Settings persist across sessions, and enhancements follow the primary video on supported pages (YouTube watch pages, Twitch/Kick channel homes).

## Tips

- The overlay button only appears while hovering the main video to stay out of the way during normal viewing.
- If you notice halos at high sharpen levels, lower contrast slightly for a more balanced image.
- The panel remembers its position; drag it to a comfortable spot and it will stay there the next time you open it.
